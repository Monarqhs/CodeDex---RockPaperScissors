# Rock Paper Scissors Game ✊✋✌️

This is a mini-project for the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, played in the terminal. The player faces off against a CPU that makes a random choice. This project was created to practice fundamental Python programming logic, user input handling, and simple data structures.

This project is part of an exercise from Codedex.

Demo

Rock Paper Scissors

===================

1) ✊
2) ✋
3) ✌️

Pick a number: 2

You chose: ✋
CPU chose: ✊

The player won!


**Key Features**

Classic Gameplay: The universally known rules of Rock Paper Scissors.

Player vs. CPU: Face off against a computer opponent whose choices are randomized using Python's random module.

Interactive Terminal Interface: Uses emojis for a clean and engaging visual representation.

Input Validation: Ensures the player can only enter a valid choice (1, 2, or 3) before the game proceeds.


**Structured Code**: Written with clear functions and an efficient data structure (a dictionary) to manage the game's logic.


**Technologies Used
Python 3
**
random module (for CPU logic)

os module (for clearing the terminal screen)
